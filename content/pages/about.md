**Amin Roudaki** is a Software Engineer from [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), Washington, USA. With over 20+ years of experience in building wide range of software development projects. From building start ups to working at big tech Microsoft and Google.

For the last 10 my main focus is big data solutions which are able to process peta-byte of data in near realtime. Followings are some of my recent works:

- Currently At Coupang.com leading the team to built the realtime Ads budgeting service, which provides unified Ads budget across all coupangs service. It can handle ultra higher traffic, while providing sub-milliseconds latency. Also leading the team to build a unified data platform which gives access real-time access to many different data sources needed for Ads Serving, Indexing and Ranking.

- At Google led a team of engineers to build a new, fully automated, rule-based distributed mutation platform on the Ads back-end database. This system monitors changes to data across all Ad campaign data and performs further mutations based on the defined rules. It processes over 20K/s operations, and it mutates over 3K/s entities. 

- At Microsoft Skype built the first streaming data platform for Skype telemetry system. Handling the ultra-large-scale of data within minute latency.
